# An Analysis of Nothing
---
Exploring character occurrences and NLP with Seinfeld scripts.

## Project Goal:
* We aim to build a web application/dashboard that allows users to explore the occurence

## Project Type:
* Tool

##  Questions/Tasks of Interest
* Interactive visual dashboard:
  * Chronicle appearances of each character across the series across an interactive visual dashboad.
* Identify correlations between characters and audience ratings:
  * Is any single character's appearances correlated with episode success?
* Search Query:
  * Allow users to search for specific episodes based on partially remembered dialogue snippets.
* Basic Recommender System:
  * Find similar episodes to a user's favorite.

## Data:
* Complete scripts for all 173 episodes of Seinfeld found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/thec03u5/seinfeld-chronicles).
* Audience ratings for each episode found on [IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/).
* Viewer counts for each episode found on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Seinfeld_episodes#Ratings).
